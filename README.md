# NLP - Text Generators

This project is all about word and text generators. Basically it should become a whole collection of different text generator techniques. The text generators are often not new but here and there I'll add my own twist to it.

# Generators

 - [N-Gram word generator (Markov Chain)](https://github.com/verbeemen/NLP--text_generators/tree/master/nlp_text_generators/n_gram_word_generator)
 - [CBOW word generator](https://github.com/verbeemen/NLP--text_generators/tree/master/nlp_text_generators/cbow_word_generator)
